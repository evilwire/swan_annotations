\section{Localization}

For the following, let $\Cat{A}$ be an abelian category, and
let $\Cat{C}$ be a Serre subcategory. The following sections will
deal with the following two questions:

\noindent {\bf Problem 1.} Find an exact functor $T$ and an 
abelian category $\Cat{A}/\Cat{C}$ with $T: \Cat{A} \to 
\Cat{A}/\Cat{C}$ such that if $F: \Cat{A} \to \Cat{B}$ is an 
exact functor which annihilates $\Cat{C}$ then there exists a 
unique functor $G$ with $F = GT$; $G$ will be exact. This is 
possible if $\Cat{A}$ is well-powered (proven in the next 
section) or if $\Cat{C}$ is localizing.

\noindent {\bf Problem 2.} Find an exact functor $T$ from 
$\Cat{A}$ to some category $\Cat{D}$ which is universal for exact 
functors which annihilate $\Cat{C}$ up to natural isomophism. 
That is, given the diagram
\[
\begin{diagram}
   &          & D           \\
   & \ruTo{T} & \dDashto{G} \\
 A \\
   & \rdTo{F} \\
   &          & B
\end{diagram}
\]
where $F$ is exact and annihilates $C$. Then $G: \Cat{D} \to
\Cat{B}$ is exact and $GT$ is naturally isomorphic to $F$
and any other $G'$ is naturally isomorphic to $G$.

We solve the problems first for $\Cat{C}$ localizing.

\begin{prop}
If $\Cat{C}$ is localizing, then $\Cat{L}$ and the reflection
$R: \Cat{A} \to \Cat{L}$ solves Problem 2.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
Let $F: \Cat{A} \to \Cat{B}$ be exact and annihilate $\Cat{C}$.
Set $G = F|_{\Cat{L}}$. Certainly the following commutes:
\[
\begin{diagram}
   &          & \Cat{L}     \\
   & \ruTo{T} & \dDashto{G} \\
 A \\
   & \rdTo{F} \\
   &          & B
\end{diagram}
\]
We must show that $G$ is exact. For s.e.s. in $\Cat{L}$,
\[
0 \to L' \to L \to L'' \to 0
\]
we have
\[
0 \to L' \to L \to L'' \to C \to 0
\]
in $\Cat{A}$, and applying $R$, note that $C \in \Cat{C}$;
but $\Cat{C}$ is annihilated by $F$. Therefore, $FC = 0$,
and $G = F|_{\Cat{L}}$ is exact.

Next, we show $GR$ is naturally iso to $F$. For each $A \in
\Cat{A}$, we have a $\Cat{C}$-iso $u_A : A \to RA$, which
induces an iso $FA \to FRA$ which is natural in $A$. As
$FRA = GRA$, $FA \to GRA$ is a natural iso.

Finally, we show that $F|_{\Cat{C}}$ is universal. Fix a
natural iso $\nu : GR \to F$. Then $\nu|_{\Cat{L}}$ is a
natural isomorphism from $GR|_{\Cat{L}} \to F|_{\Cat{L}}$.
But $GR|_{\Cat{L}} = G$.
\end{proof}

\begin{rmk}
I have yet to give a satisfactory explanation to the following 
passage, taken directly from Swan's notes:

\begin{quotation}
It could happen that $\Cat{A}$ was very big and $\Cat{L}$ small 
(by creating a new equivalent category with lots of objects in 
each is isomorphism type of $\Cat{A}$ not in $\Cat{L}$). Then the 
above construction won't work for problem 1 because $R$ will 
identify too many objects to be able to factor $F$ as $GR$. This
is the only difficulty. We remove it by the following construction.
\end{quotation}

This lies at the heart of differentiating Problem 2 from Problem
1:
