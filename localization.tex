\section{Localization}

For the following, let $\Cat{A}$ be an abelian category, and
let $\Cat{C}$ be a Serre subcategory. The following sections will
deal with the following two questions:

\noindent {\bf Problem 1.} Find an exact functor $T$ and an 
abelian category $\Cat{A}/\Cat{C}$ with $T: \Cat{A} \to 
\Cat{A}/\Cat{C}$ such that if $F: \Cat{A} \to \Cat{B}$ is an 
exact functor which annihilates $\Cat{C}$ then there exists a 
unique functor $G$ with $F = GT$; $G$ will be exact. This is 
possible if $\Cat{A}$ is well-powered (proven in the next 
section) or if $\Cat{C}$ is localizing.

\noindent {\bf Problem 2.} Find an exact functor $T$ from 
$\Cat{A}$ to some category $\Cat{D}$ which is universal for exact 
functors which annihilate $\Cat{C}$ up to natural isomophism. 
That is, given the diagram
\[
\begin{diagram}
   &          & D           \\
   & \ruTo{T} & \dDashto{G} \\
 A \\
   & \rdTo{F} \\
   &          & B
\end{diagram}
\]
where $F$ is exact and annihilates $C$. Then $G: \Cat{D} \to
\Cat{B}$ is exact and $GT$ is naturally isomorphic to $F$
and any other $G'$ is naturally isomorphic to $G$.

\begin{thm}
If $\Cat{C}$ is localizing, then $\Cat{L}$ and the reflection
$R: \Cat{A} \to \Cat{L}$ solves Problem 2.
